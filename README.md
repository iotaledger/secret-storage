# Cryptographic Key Management Library

This library provides a comprehensive solution for managing cryptographic keys within Rust applications. It defines a set of traits for creating, signing, deleting, checking the existence of, and retrieving cryptographic keys, making it a versatile tool for secure key management.

## Features

- **Key Creation**: Generate new cryptographic keys with ease.
- **Key Signing**: Utilize keys for signing operations.
- **Key Deletion**: Safely delete keys when they are no longer needed.
- **Key Existence Check**: Verify the existence of keys in the storage.
- **Key Retrieval**: Retrieve keys for use in cryptographic operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This library is built with Rust, so you'll need Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can install them from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation
